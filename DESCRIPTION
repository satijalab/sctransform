Description: A normalization method for single-cell UMI count data using a 
  variance stabilizing transformation. The transformation is based on a 
  negative binomial regression model with regularized parameters. As part of the
  same regression framework, this package also provides functions for
  differential gene expression testing, batch correction, and data
  correction/denoising.
